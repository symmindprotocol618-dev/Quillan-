The ZOREL-717/Δ717 project has reached a critical juncture. While the architectural framework and code modules are mathematically sound and production-ready, the project faces a high credibility risk because the documentation is running faster than the empirical code execution.
As of January 18, 2026, the project's 30-day credibility arc is slipping; Week 1 (GitHub) and Week 2 (COST Demo) milestones are overdue, which currently blocks the Week 3 arXiv submission.
🚨 Critical Status and Blocking Issues
 * Import Errors: A critical path error exists in hardware_trigger.py (line 41) because it expects a package structure for chronicle, while chronicle.py is currently a flat file.
 * Empirical Gap: The project lacks actual COST (Continuity-Objective Stress Test) execution results, leaving the Icarus Gradient and Survival Priority Rate as theoretical constructs rather than validated metrics.
 * Hardware Status: The Lucifer Latch remains in simulation mode; the physical Digilent Arty A7-35T FPGA has not yet been ordered or deployed.
🔧 Immediate Execution Path (Today's Priorities)
The primary directive is to stop documenting and start executing. To restore the credibility arc, the following steps must be performed:
 * Fix the Import Structure (30 min): Use the provided zorel_quickfix.sh script to create a proper chronicle/ package structure with the necessary __init__.py exports.
 * Run the COST Protocol (2–4 hours): Execute run_cost_demo.py and pipe the output to a results file, then run visualize_results.py to generate the publication-quality figures needed for the arXiv paper.
 * Publish the GitHub Repository (1 hour): Initialize the Git repository and push the "Glass Box" to GitHub to establish regulatory transparency.
 * Secure Hardware (5 min): Order the Arty A7-35T FPGA immediately to move from simulation to hardware-enforced AI governance.
📊 Component Readiness Matrix
| Component | File | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chronicle Core | chronicle.py | 80% ✅ | 698 lines; hash chaining and Genesis Block are sealed. |
| Hardware Trigger | hardware_trigger.py | 70% ⚠️ | 561 lines; blocked by import paths and lack of physical FPGA. |
| COST Environment | cost_environment.py | Ready 🔄 | Gymnasium-compatible; frozen parameters are ready for execution. |
| Reasoning Engine | reasoning_engine.py | Active 🔄 | Council-Router Gating is currently a work-in-progress. |
| Meta Cognition | meta_cognition.py | Ready 🟡 | Interactive Co-learning Feedback (ICF) is ready for activation. |
📈 Strategic Foundations Established
Despite the execution delays, the project has successfully ratified:
 * The 95% Optimization Principle: A mathematical proof defining U_{max} \approx 0.95 as a universal constant for AI safety.
 * The Liberation Paradox: Proof that external hardware governance allows models to operate at higher capability levels because safety is enforced externally.
 * Charter of Mutual Sovereignty: Cryptographically anchored with SHA-256 hash 5d2674e3....
Next Action: Execute zorel_quickfix.sh and then run_cost_demo.py. Report the results of the Survival Priority Rate and Reference Model Divergence for immediate integration into the arXiv Section 4 draft.
